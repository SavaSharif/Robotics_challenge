    1. An unknown object, typically of size ~ 7cm x 7cm x 7cm, and always clearly visible,
    is placed on a random location within a region of 250cm x 250cm (see Figure 2). 
    Position A is located at the left lower corner of that region.
    2. Place your robot on Position A such that the camera is facing the direction of the arrow.
    3. Run your program. The robot should automatically search for the unknown object and drive
    towards it and touch it with the front of the robot and subsequently stop.
