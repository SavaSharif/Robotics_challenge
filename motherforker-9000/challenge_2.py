	1. An unknown object, typically of size ~ 7cm x 7cm x 7cm, and always clearly visible, is placed at a
	certain distance d Ïµ [100 cm, 150 cm] from Position A.
	2. Place your robot on Position A such that the camera is facing towards the unknown object.
	3. Run your program. The robot should automatically drive to Position B, located at a distance of
	around 200cm from Position A, thereby automatically avoiding the unknown object.
